# Capstone
The dataset used at the beginning of this project can be found at:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

References to this files may need to be updated from the location on the local machine to match the location wherever the code below is run.

finalDatasetGeneration.ipynb was used to create the final aggregated dataset which is saved in the file:
finalDatasetNew.csv

Once that was completed, then Capstone.ipynb was run to import finalDatasetNew.csv to complete the rest of the project.
